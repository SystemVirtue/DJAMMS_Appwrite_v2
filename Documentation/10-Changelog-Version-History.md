# DJAMMS Changelog and Version History

## v3.1.0 - Venue ID Refactor (In Progress)
**Release Date**: September 25, 2025
**Status**: In Development

### 🚀 Major Changes
- **Venue ID System**: All user/player instance association now uses a unique `venue_id` instead of userId.
- **Schema Update**: Added `venue_id` to `djamms_users` and `player_instances` collections. Removed `userId` from `player_instances`.
- **Persistent Player Instances**: Player instance lookup/creation now uses `venue_id`, preventing redundant instances and ensuring persistent association per venue.
- **Login Flow Update**: On first login, dev-approved users are prompted for a unique Venue ID (validated, no spaces, must be unique).
- **Documentation Updated**: All relevant docs and API schemas now reference `venue_id`.

### 🛠️ Migration Notes
- Existing player instances and users must be migrated to use the new `venue_id` field.
- All code and API endpoints referencing userId for player instances must be updated to use `venue_id`.

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v1.1.x to v1.2.x

#### Step 1: Update Dependencies
```bash
npm update @skeletonlabs/skeleton
npm update appwrite
npm update @playwright/test
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Instance Management
```typescript
// Add to app initialization
import { initializeInstanceManagement } from '$lib/services/InstanceService';

onMount(async () => {
    await initializeInstanceManagement('dashboard');
});
```

#### Step 3: Update Service Calls
```typescript
// Update service initialization with instance context
const jukeboxService = getContext<JukeboxService>('jukeboxService');

// Services now handle instance tracking automatically
await jukeboxService.updateState({ status: 'playing' });
```

#### Step 4: Database Migration
```javascript
// Run migration script
node scripts/migrate-to-v1.2.0.js

// Or manually create instance_states collection in Appwrite Console
```

### Migrating from v1.0.x to v1.1.x

await databases.createStringAttribute('djamms_db', 'priority_queue', 'source', 20, true, 'user_request');
```

#### Step 2: Update Queue Priority Logic
```typescript
// Change priority values in existing code
const HIGH_PRIORITY = 1;    // Was: 10
const MEDIUM_PRIORITY = 5;  // Was: 5  
const LOW_PRIORITY = 10;    // Was: 1
