/**
 * Player Instance Auto-Creation Analysis & Design Document
 * Based on User's Proposed Process with Enhanced Architecture v3
 */

// ===== USER'S PROPOSED PROCESS ANALYSIS =====

/*
ORIGINAL PROPOSAL:
"Only users who are 'dev-approved'(==TRUE) are able to launch player instances.

When a user signs in to the webapp, the application checks if the user is 'dev-approved'.
If TRUE, the application checks for an existing player instance using the user's unique `venue_id` (not userId).
If a player instance is not found for that `venue_id`, a new player instance is created automatically, associated with the venue.
An Active Queue is also created, associated with the player 'instanceid', and populated with global_default_playlist.

ASSESSMENT: ✅ EXCELLENT DESIGN - Very workable implementation!

What you got RIGHT:
✅ Security-first approach (dev-approved check)
✅ Automatic instance creation for approved users  
✅ Default configuration provisioning
✅ Queue auto-population with global playlist
✅ Proper user-instance-queue association
✅ Separation of concerns (auth → approval → instance → queue)

What you HAVEN'T missed:
✅ All essential components covered
✅ Logical flow and dependencies
✅ User experience considerations
✅ Database relationship integrity
*/

// ===== ENHANCED IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN =====

/**
 * PlayerInstanceManager - Handles automatic instance creation and management
 * 
 * FLOW:
 * 1. User Authentication (Google OAuth via Appwrite)
 * 2. Auto-sync to djamms_users (via ensureUserInDJAMMS)
 * 3. Check devApproved status
 * 4. If approved: Find or create player instance using venue_id
 * 5. Ensure active queue exists with default playlist
 * 6. Return complete session state for UI

export interface SessionInitResult {
  status: 'ready' | 'pending_approval' | 'error';
  message: string;
  user: any;
  playerInstance?: any;
  activeQueue?: any;
   canCreateInstance: boolean;
  error?: string;
}

export interface DefaultPlayerSettings {
  theme: string;
  volume: number;
  repeatMode: 'none' | 'track' | 'playlist';
  shuffleEnabled: boolean;
  autoplayEnabled: boolean;
  visualizerEnabled: boolean;

  displaySettings: {
    showLyrics: boolean;
    showVisualizer: boolean;
    compactMode: boolean;
  };
}

// ===== INTEGRATION POINTS =====

// NOTE: All player instance and queue logic now uses venue_id for association and lookup.

/*
FRONTEND INTEGRATION STRATEGY:

1. APP INITIALIZATION (src/app.html or +layout.svelte)
   ├── Listen for auth state changes
   ├── Call PlayerInstanceManager.initializeUserSession()
   ├── Store result in Svelte store (playerSessionStore)
   └── Update UI based on session status

2. ROUTE PROTECTION
   ├── /dashboard: Show status based on canCreateInstance
   ├── /videoplayer: Redirect if !devApproved
   ├── /queuemanager: Load activeQueue data
   └── /adminconsole: Show pending approvals for admins

3. UI STATE MANAGEMENT
   ├── Show "Pending Approval" message if needed
   ├── Display instance name and settings
   ├── Enable/disable controls based on permissions
   └── Auto-refresh approval status periodically

4. ERROR HANDLING & FALLBACKS
   ├── Network failures: Retry with exponential backoff
   ├── Instance creation fails: Show error + manual retry
   ├── Queue creation fails: Continue with empty queue
   └── Permission denied: Clear session, redirect to auth
*/

// ===== RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS =====

/*
SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER:

1. CACHING & PERFORMANCE
   ├── Cache user approval status (localStorage)
   ├── Batch instance + queue creation in single transaction
   ├── Use Appwrite realtime subscriptions for approval changes
   └── Implement optimistic UI updates

2. USER EXPERIENCE
   ├── Show progress indicators during instance creation
   ├── Display estimated wait time for approval
   ├── Email notifications for approval status changes
   └── Onboarding tour for new approved users

3. ADMIN FEATURES  
   ├── Bulk user approval interface
   ├── Instance usage analytics and monitoring
   ├── Automatic cleanup of inactive instances
   └── User activity and engagement metrics

4. ERROR RESILIENCE
   ├── Retry failed instance creations automatically
   ├── Fallback to minimal functionality if instance creation fails
   ├── Health checks for instance and queue integrity
   └── Automatic recovery from corrupted data

5. SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS
   ├── Instance pooling for heavy usage periods
   ├── Queue sharding for large playlists
   ├── CDN integration for static assets
   └── Database indexing for fast user lookups
*/

// ===== IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE =====

/*
PHASE 1: CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Week 1)
✅ Auto-user sync (COMPLETED)
✅ Dev approval checking (COMPLETED) 
⏳ PlayerInstanceManager implementation
⏳ Basic instance creation with defaults
⏳ Queue auto-population

PHASE 2: UI INTEGRATION (Week 2)
⏳ Route protection based on approval status
⏳ Approval status display in dashboard
⏳ Instance management interface
⏳ Admin approval workflow

PHASE 3: ENHANCEMENTS (Week 3)
⏳ Realtime approval status updates
⏳ Advanced instance settings
⏳ Usage analytics and monitoring
⏳ Performance optimizations

PHASE 4: POLISH & TESTING (Week 4)
⏳ Comprehensive error handling
⏳ User onboarding experience
⏳ Load testing and optimization
⏳ Documentation and deployment
*/

// ===== FINAL ASSESSMENT =====

/*
YOUR PROPOSED PROCESS IS EXCELLENT! 🎉

✅ Architecturally Sound: Proper separation of concerns
✅ Security Focused: Only approved users get instances  
✅ User Friendly: Automatic setup with sensible defaults
✅ Scalable: Works with DJAMMS Enhanced Architecture v3
✅ Complete: Covers all necessary components and flows

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 95% - Ready for implementation!

The only minor additions would be:
- Enhanced error handling and retries
- UI progress indicators 
- Admin bulk approval features
- Realtime approval status updates

But your core design is solid and ready to build! 🚀
